       <h3>• Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive design is a web development method for automatically adjusting content and elements according to the screen size of the client's smart device.
          An example would be the addition of mobile websites to the smart phone browsers of today. Compact UI and interface populated with all the meaningful accessability
        found on the desktop and running on memory found in a phone makes this a powerful solution among web developers. It makes a website easier to manage and can reduce maintenance cost of site.</p>

       <br />
       <h3>• How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ever changing online services and end users demand the adaptability of responsive design for their most crucial needs.
         As a software engineer, is it my duty to observe these requests and relate them in my own work. In order for even a web page to be optimized
         and run with responsive design, there exists an element of efficiency where we are making more from less. As variety of devices become smaller
         with passing time, web technologies will have to embrace these changes. A good example would be the notch on the new smartphones and how developers 
         choose to work around this bezel or use it to their advantage for better presentation when an application is running.
       </p>


        <br />
        <h3>• What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned that just because browsers run on the same operating system does not necessarily mean the layouts and ultimately 
          presentation behave the same way.
          When testing between Chrome and Microsoft Edge at first I noticed some of my original fonts would not appear on the Edge browser due to them being
          unrecognized. I had to change them to compromise and chose adaptability over presentation. Some settings would not persist on the Edge browser either,
          this may be due to an incompatibility. 
        </p>


        <br />
        <h3>• Finally, describe your learning experience in this course.</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript may be the most handy language I've learned yet. There are billions of practical applications as well which is why
          I believe it to be such a powerful language as well. The most
          difficult part of the course was probably the 
          struggle I had with DOM manipulation and
          refraining from using innerHTML! This course has boosted my confidence in web development and I cannot wait to begin my own
        sites using innerHTML, AJAX, JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, dynamic data and form validation! Thank you for the opportunity. </p>
